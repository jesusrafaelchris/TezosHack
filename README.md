[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Showcase is an augmented reality powered mobile dapp that empowers independent artists and curators, by enabling them to create their own pop-up art exhibition to display and sell their digital artwork.

## Installation

Showcase requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd server
npm i
node app
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```

- `RealityKit` - augmented reality package for iOS
- `node.js` - evented I/O for the backend
- `express.js` - fast node.js network app framework
